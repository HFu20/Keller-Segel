This is the Matlab code for the paper "A decoupled linear, mass-conservative block-centered finite difference method for the Keller--Segel chemotaxis system" published in Journal of Computational Physics, by Jie Xu and Hongfei Fu.
The decoupled linear and mass-conservative BCFD scheme is developed for the Kellerâ€“Segel system in 2D and 3D.
